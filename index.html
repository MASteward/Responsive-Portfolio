      <p>I served five years in the United States Army in the prestigious 82nd Airborne Division stationed at Fort Bragg North Carolina. During my service I deployed twice to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. After my service, I returned home to enroll in the local community college before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin. In 2015, I graduated from with a Bachelors of Arts in Political Science and Sociology.</p>

      <p>After graduating, I search for a job in my field of studies to which I found none. So I worked at various temp. jobs where they had nothing to do with anything I spent studying the 4 years prior. During this time I decided I would take an alternative route and attempt to learn about computers and web development. To my suprise, I actually enjoyed the logic (most of the time) computer programs were created from.</p>
